Mongoose is a library for Node.js and MongoDB that makes it easier to work with MongoDB

It acts as a bridge between our JavaScript code and the MongoDB database


Some keys aspects of Mongoose :

    - It lets us define a structure for our data using a schema
        - For example, 
            const TodoSchema = new mongoose.Schema({
                title: String,
                desc: String,
                isDone: Boolean,
            })


    - It provides a set of methods that allows us to perform common database operations (like saving, updating, and querying data) using simple JavaScript code
        - For example, Todo.findOne(), Todo.deleteMany(), Todo.insertMany(), etc...


    - It allows us to define rules for our data i.e., we can specify that, a certain field must contain a number only or some other datatype as well
        - For example, 
            const TodoSchema = new mongoose.Schema({
                title: {type: String, required: true, default: "No Title"},
                desc: String,
                isDone: Boolean,
                days: Number
            })

        - In the above example, we have defined some set of rules to create a Todo object


    - It also lets us define middleware functions that run before or after certain database operations, giving us more control over the data


    - It manages the connection to the MongoDB database for us
        - For example, mongoose.connect(`mongodb://localhost:27017/todo`)
        - The above example will connect to the local database of our system
