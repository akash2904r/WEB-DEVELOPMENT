# Redux

Redux is basically used to avoid prop drilling

Some of the basic terminologies :

- Store - Is what holds all the data your application uses

- Reducer - Is what manipulates that data when it recieves an action

- Action - Is what tells reducer to manipulate the store data, it carries the name and (not required) some data

- Dispatcher: To change something in the state, you need to dispatch an action (and that is what dispatcher does)
