Entites are used when the synatx of html and the content that we are willing to write collides

For example, if we want to write the syntax of paragraph tag i.e., <p></p>, as a content. If we directly write it as <p></p> itself then according to html it will considered as a paragraph itself. So we use, &lt; for the '<' and &gt; for '>' symbol.

Therefore to write paragraph tag as a content we must write it as &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
Where lt means lower than and gt means greater than

<pre> -> This tag is used to keep the spaces left and the new lines intact or as it is. But for tags we must use entites only

&copy; -> This is used to get the copyright symbol i.e., Â©

&nbsp; -> This is used for leaving spaces, as html doesn't consider spaces more than one

<blockquote> -> When we write some text with these tags it is considered as quotations by the browser

blockquote also has an attribute 'cite="source-url"' used to cite texts. We must give the url has the value for cite attribute

<q> -> This is also same as blockquote tag. This tag also has cite attribute. But when we use this tag, we can see the quotation symbols "" in our website

<code> -> If any type of code is required to be written, we can use code tag and write the code inside it, so that the browser can understand it in a better way

<canvas> -> It is an element used to make graphical shapes
