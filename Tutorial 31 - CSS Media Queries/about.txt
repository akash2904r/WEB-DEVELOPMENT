Media Queries are used to make our website responsive

Basic syntax of a media query is :
    @media not/only media_type and (expressions) {
        CSS-Code;
    }

Some of the media types are screen, all, print, speech etc



* flex-direction : This property is used to change the direction of the elements that have the display property as flex i.e., flex-direction: column; So all the elements would be arranged in a column when we write this CSS code  



Orientation has 2 main values :

- portrait : When the height of the viewport is maximum, then it is considered as portrait 

- landscape : When the width of the viewport is maximum, then it is considered as landscape
