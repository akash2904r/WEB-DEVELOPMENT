The total width and height of the element is calculated with the formula:

Total Width = Width + Left Padding + Right Padding + Left Border + Right Border + Left Margin + Right Margin

Total Height = Height + Top Padding + Bottom Padding + Top Border + Bottom Border + Top Margin + Bottom Margin



When we give both 'height' and 'box-sizing: border-box' in a selector that simply means the given height is a sum of the content written, padding and border. Whereas, if we had given only the 'height', that implies the height of the content only



Margin Collapse : It is an concept that is applied when two margins collide with each other. So when this happens, the max of both margins is applied as the margin

The margin which is minimum is just overlapped onto the maximum margin (Take a look at the pic)
