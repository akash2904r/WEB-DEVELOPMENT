- box-shadow : h-offset v-offset blur spread color inset;

    * h-offset and v-offset : Determines the shadow's horizontal and vertical position i.e., basically how long do you require the shadow to be
    * blur : Larger the value, blurier the shadow
    * spread : Expands or shrinks the size of shadow
    * color : Defines the shadow color
    * inset : Makes the shadow inner i.e., how in would you like the shadow to be


- text-shadow : h-offset v-offset blur color;

    * Same as box-shadow


- outline : width style color;

Outline and border are very much similar and some of the difference between them are:
1) Position : Outlines don't take space, they're drawn around the element, outside the border (They don't belong in the box-model concept)
2) Offset : Using outline-offset property we can set the space between an outline and the border of an element
3) Width : Outlines have a uniform width, whereas borders can have varying widths on different sides
4) Rounded Corners : Borders can have rounded corners using the property border-radius, while outline generally cannot. If they do have a rounded corner then it must have been inherited from the border of that particular element
