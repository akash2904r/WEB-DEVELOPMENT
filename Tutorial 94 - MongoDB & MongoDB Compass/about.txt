MongoDB is a popular NoSQL database management system that is designed to store, manage, and retrieve data in a flexible and scalable manner

A database is a structured collection of organized data that is stored and can be easily accessed, managed, and updated


Some key points about MongoDB are :

    - MongoDB is a type of NoSQL (Not Only SQL) database, which means it doesn't follow the traditional relational database model like SQL databases (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL)

    - Unlike SQL databases, MongoDB uses a flexible, document-oriented data model.

    - MongoDB stores data in flexible, JSON-like documents, which are called BSON (Binary JSON) documents

    - Each document can have a different structure, allowing you to store data in a way that fits the application's needs

    - In MongoDB, a collection is like a container for storing related data. You can think of it as similar to a table in a traditional relational database

    - Each collection can hold multiple documents, and these documents don't need to have the same structure or fields

    - A document is a record or an entry in a collection. It's a set of key-value pairs, similar to a JSON object

    - Unlike a row in a traditional database table, a document can have a dynamic and flexible structure i.e., each document within a collection can have different fields or attributes

    - Unlike a relational database, in MongoDB, we don't need to set up a fixed structure (schema) for our data before storing it i.e., for example, table etc...

    - MongoDB is open source, which means we can use, modify, and distribute the software freely
