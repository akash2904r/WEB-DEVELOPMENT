DOM stands for Document Object Model

DOM is used to map the entire HTML code as an documentary


document.body is used to represent the body of an HTML code as an tree like structure


Using DOM we can even inject inline CSS to the elements
    - For example, document.body.style.backgroundColor = "black";



BOM stands for Browser Object Model

When we use BOM we get additional objects other than document such as location etc



DOM and BOM are mainly used to target particular elements to style them or do some other changes



window is also an object and it is an global object
    - For example, window.document.body
    - We can write this example even without the 'window.' portion
