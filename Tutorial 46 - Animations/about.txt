Syntax to define an animation :
    @keyframes name_of_the_animation {
        Code;
    }


animation property is made up of 7 different properties :

1) animation-name : In this property, we must give the name of the animation that we want to apply for an element
    - Syntax : animation-name: myAnimation;
    - In the above syntax, myAnimation is the name of the animation that should be applied for the element


2) animation-duration : In this property, we give the time for how long must the animation take place
    - Syntax : animation-duration: 2s (time);
    - For the above written syntax the animation will take place for 2 seconds


3) animation-timing-function : This property helps us to know how does the element move initially and as it goes on moving until it's destination (or at what speed at particular instance of time)
    - cubic-bezier() is the value that tells about this movement or the speed of the element at particular instances


4) animation-delay : In this property also we must give a time and this time means, after how long should the animation take place
    - Syntax : transition-delay: 1s (time);
    - For the above written syntax the animation will start after 1 second


5) animation-iteration-count : In this property, we can define how many times should the animation occur
    - Syntax : animation-iteration-count: 3;
    - For the above written syntax the animation will occur 3 times only
    - We can even make the value 'infinte'


6) animation-direction : In this property, we can define the direction of animation i.e., reverse, alternate, alternate-reverse, normal etc.
    - reverse : When we use this value the animation takes place backwards
    - alternate : For example, if the element is moving from left-right then using this value, we can make it move left-right once and the next time right-left and it goes on
    - alternate-reverse : It is an combination of reverse and alternate i.e., the element if moving from left-right, it will move right-left once and left-right next and goes on
    - normal : It is the default value


7) animation-fill-mode : This property helps the element to retain it's property even after the iteration count is over
    - Some of the values are : 
        - backwards : The element will retain it's properties i.e., the properties that the element has at the start of the animation
        - forwards : The element will retain it's properties i.e., the properties that the element has at the end of the animation
        - both : It is the combination of backwards and forwards


* animation-play-state : This property is used to pause the animation or keep it running
    - Some of the values are :
        - running : It keeps the animation playing until the iteration count is completed
        - paused : If we use this value, we can stop the element right at the point where it was running i.e., say element moves from 0-9 and we use paused at 5 then the element will stop right at 5 itself and won't return back to it's normal position


* animation : This property is a combination of all 7 properties discussed above
    - Syntax : name duration timing-function delay iteration-count direction fill-mode;
    - We can even leave the properties that we don't require in the given syntax
    - Also if we want to add more than 1 animation, we can use comma (,) to separate the animations i.e., name1 duration1 timing-function1 delay1 iteration-count1, name2 duration2 timing-function2 iteration-count2 direction2;
