JavaScript can be used in both frontend and backend

- When javascript is used in frontend we usually use a <script> tag or a .js file
- On the other hand, when we use it in the backend we use node.js


var is an keyword used to declare an variable

confirm() is used to give us a "OK or Cancel" button to choose from

prompt is used to get a user input


We can even change the styling using javascript like,
    - document.title = "JavaScript Intro";
    - document.body.style.backgroundColor = "black";
    - document.body.style.color = "white";

Whenever we use javascript to style elements the style is applied as an inline CSS to the elements
