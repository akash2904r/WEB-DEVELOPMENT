Some of the values used in filter property are : 

1) blur() : This value is used to increase or decrease the bluriness of the image
    - px can also be used as unit

2) brightness() : As the name itself suggests, this value is used to increase and decrease the brightness of an image 

3) contrast() : Used to increase or decrease the contrast of an image 

4) greyscale() : When we use this property, we can make our image into a black-white image (i.e., when 100%)

5) sepia() : It is kind of similar to greyscale, but the color is bit different than black-white

6) invert() : This value is used to invert an image i.e., to convert an image into it's negative version
    - It's value ranges from 0 to 1 (or) we can % as unit

7) opacity() : Used to deal with the transparency of the image



We can apply mutiple filters by leaving space between each value i.e., 
    - For example, filter: brightness(100%) contrast(30%) opacity(0.3);
