    <h1>Structure of HTML</h1>
    <p>#1 HTML contains two types of tags:
        <p>a) Self closing tags -> Contains only opening tag, there are no closing tags present. For example, <meta> tag </p>

        <p>b) Pair tags -> Contains an opening as well as closing tag. For example, head tag, p tag (paragraph tag) etc.</p>
    </p>

    <p>#2 The things that are seen on the screen are the thing present inside the body tag</p>
